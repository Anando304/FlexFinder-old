# FlexFinder

An App created during DeltaHacks V to help students find a workout buddy nearby on campus for workout sessions. 

For many university students, it's hard to find time for exercise in their busy schedules, and even harder to find friends to exercise with. Due to this, a general sense of apathy is the only barrier between students and good health. If we reduce the friction in the process of finding a workout buddy with a schedule that matches yours, and motivating factors are added into the mix, that barrier can easily be broken.

Flex Finder is a modern solution to the above problem space. Combining the familiar and intuitive user flows of current popular apps such as Uber, Tinder and Snapchat, Flex Finder re-contextualizes them for social good in the form of an easy, convenient and fun social media platform for exercise. The app allows users to easily see and connect with nearby potential work-out buddies, using Location Services with Google Maps API. There are filters for types of work-out, routine, and the ability to track work-out schedules. When work-outs are followed through with, users increase their "Flex Score", an implementation of gamification, encouraging users to exercise more frequently.
